Description:

Simulated business scenario The city's LLM-based customer service system is constrained by its training cutoff date, rendering it unable to use the most recent customer data. This limitation prevents the system from delivering the up-to-the-minute personalization that customers expect because their latest interactions and preferences are not reflected in the model's recommendations and support.

Overview: In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, you review a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS. After the design is completed, you build the proposed solution in a guided lab within a live AWS Management Console environment. You gain hands-on experience working with AWS services, using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.

Objectives: Identify the Agents for Amazon Bedrock core functions. Identify the steps involved in configuring an agent so that Amazon Bedrock can interact with organizational data and user queries. Explain the process of integrating an agent to automate a customer-focused task, such as handling reservations or customer inquiries.

AWS Services: Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon Simple Storage Service, AWS Secrets Manager
